# About
Implementation of PPO, DQN, VPG agenst in Tensorflow to solve Atari Pong and CartPole. 
Some of the agents are also implemented in Tensorflow Eager and PyTorch.

This repository serves the purpose of self-teaching. The implementations 
are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested or numerically stable. We advise 
against using this software for non-didactic purposes.
